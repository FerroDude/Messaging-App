The main goal of this project was to learn more about Next.js and Firebase, integrate these with React and work with SSO using Google Authentication.
To use you need to login with your google account and add the email of the person you want to talk with. User icon is used to logout.

Main technologies used:
 - React
 - Next.js
 - Firebase (Firestore, Authentication)
 - Material-UI
 - Styled Components

The app is functional, to improve on this in the future I will implement: 
 - Voice messages
 - File sending
 - Chats Search
 - Emoji/Gif support
