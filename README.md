The main goal of this project was to learn more about Next.js and Firebase, integrate these with React and work with SSO using Google Authentication.

Main technologies used:
 - React
 - Next.js
 - Firebase (Firestore, Authentication)
 - Material-UI
 - Styled Components

The app is functional, to improve on this in the future I will implement: 
 - Voice messages
 - File sending
 - Chats Search
 - Emoji/Gif support
